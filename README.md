# Image OCR Comparison

This repository is dedicated to a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of two leading Optical Character Recognition (OCR) libraries: EasyOCR and Keras-OCR. OCR technology is instrumental in extracting text from images, and this project aims to delve into the nuances of both libraries, assessing their accuracy, processing speed, and ease of integration across a spectrum of image types.

**EasyOCR: A Comprehensive OCR Solution**

EasyOCR stands out as a robust OCR library that supports a wide array of languages, boasting pre-trained models that facilitate seamless text extraction from images. With over 100 supported languages, EasyOCR provides a versatile solution for diverse text recognition needs. Its ease of use and straightforward integration make it a popular choice for developers seeking reliable OCR functionality.

**Keras-OCR: Customizability and Flexibility**

In contrast, Keras-OCR is built on the Keras and TensorFlow frameworks, offering a flexible and customizable OCR pipeline. While it may require more configuration compared to EasyOCR, Keras-OCR empowers developers with the ability to tailor the OCR process to specific requirements. This flexibility makes it well-suited for projects with unique text recognition challenges.

**Comparison Metrics: Accuracy, Speed, and Ease of Use**

The comparison between EasyOCR and Keras-OCR revolves around key metrics such as accuracy, processing speed, and ease of integration. By meticulously evaluating these aspects, we aim to provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each library. The results of our comparison will be documented extensively, providing developers with valuable information to inform their choice of OCR solution.
